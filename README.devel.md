# Development guidelines

Please always follow some simple rules for coding on pymepix:
* keep the code consistent across the whole package
* document the code as well as the general documentation immediately with the
  code changes (so it goes into the same git commit)
* use git-flow (the tools and the concept)
* consistently use two empty lines between functions/methods and three empty
  lines above a class
