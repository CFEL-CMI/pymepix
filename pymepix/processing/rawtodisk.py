        Class for asynchronously writing raw files

        Constructor
        ------
        Raw2Disk(context): Constructor. Need to pass a ZMQ context object to ensure that inproc sockets can be created

        Methods
        -------

        open(filename): Creates a file with a given filename and path

        write(data): Writes data to the file. Parameter is buffer type (e.g. bytearray or memoryview)

        close(): Close the file currently in progress
